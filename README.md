Introduction
This analysis is based on a dataset from Brazil containing about 100k medical appointments. The goal is to find out how patients respond to their appointment and to also investigate on factors that influence the various responses.
Neighborhood indicates where the hospital is located
Scholarship indicates if the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare or not.
1 stands for something being present while
0 stands for it's absence
For the No-show column, No stands for a show up for the appointment while yes stands for absence at the appointment.
Questions
1. How many patients were living with different disease conditions and which is the most common?
2. Whatâ€™s the relative number of male patients compared to females?
3. What role does the Scholarship and SMS notification play in the responses of patients to return for appointments? Does it improve responses?
4. Do Males tend to neglect appointments more than females?
These were the questions explored all through the analysis to gain insight into the data and develop recommendations.
